I was just taking my break at lunch and I walked down the street about half a mile to this bakery that I really like. That does these really fancy French pastries and they were all sold out. And so I look across the street and like a Beacon of hope, I see a dunkin donuts. And so I'm walking to the dunkin donuts and of course this is all in Santa Monica, which I'd say at least 25% of the population is unhoused. So I pass like 15 homeless people on my way to the dunkin donuts and none of them say anything except this one guy and he is, I mean, they're all down on their luck, but he is extremely down on his luck and like, he's like this white guy, he should, he should be blonde, but he basically was just all Gray all over and he was like, hey, excuse me, Madam, sorry to bother you. Do you have a dollar? Could I have a dollar? And I said, oh, I'm sorry, I don't have any cash. And he said that's okay. And so I just kept walking and I went got to the dunkin donuts and I went in and I hadn't made my order and the lady gave me the wrong order and I said, oh this is the wrong doughnut and then she was like, oh, you can keep that one. I'll get you the right one too. So then I had 2 doughnuts. So I'm walking back from work, walking back from dunkin donuts back to work and the same guy is in the same place. But now he's like in the opposite direction that I'm going and so I'm like am I really going to turn around, walk all the way back up opposite direction, cross the street just to give this guy a doughnut. And then I said, you know what? Yes, I have to. So I walked back up the street, crossed the street truck, crossed all the traffic, went up to him, and I said I know I said I didn't have any cash and I don't so I'm sorry, but I do have a donut and it's yours if you want it. And he just was so happy and see that's what it's like working in Santa Monica. It's not fully gentrified yet. You hear a lot of stuff like that. But he was so happy and so grateful and so yeah, I gave him the extra doughnuts, so try to do something really nice today and go out of your way because who knows? That might just change his whole, it might not change his life, but it will certainly change his whole day around. So that sounds like a pretty good deal. Okay, bye.
